A simple configurable clock to stare back at you on your desktop

simple-desk-clock is a simple configurable Java swing clock app, that I developed about 9 years ago, but updated and optimized again in 2019.
It allows you to see how the simple power of Java and OOP can be deployed to make software utilities.

By double-tapping on the clock's surface, a settings interface is exposed and you can micro-configure many properties of the clock.
The clock also saves its state(based on changes you make from the settings interface) using Java's simple serializable techniques.

With little effort, any efficient developer can deploy the clock as an Android utility also.

Keep coding, keep improving.
